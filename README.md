# Project Name

Server Side Calculator

## Description

This project took me approximately 8 hours to solve. Having learned express, and node within the last week, getting the server running and working properly was a bit of a challenge.

I ran into a weird bug where I tried to format the CSS so it looked like a traditional calculator, and while it was successful, it was very very small on the page, so I reverted back to what I thought was decent looking CSS.

## Running project

This project was built with:
-HTML
-CSS-JQuery
-Javascript
-Node.js
-Express

The gitignore contains the node_modules so these will not load with the project.
The project wasn't built with any running server.
Will have to start the server locally to view and test features.
Can be ran with express installed and running npm start

## Usage

This project creates a basic calculator that can perform basic math such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The history is stored on the server side, so anything added after the server is running will remain on the page even after refresh.
The clear button will however clear the history.

## Credits

Huge thank you to Emerging Digital Academy for the project, opportunity and learning material.
